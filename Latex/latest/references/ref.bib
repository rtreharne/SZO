  abstract = {{The sequential pulsed laser deposition technique was used to grow
	highly transparent and c-axis oriented thin films of Si doped ZnO
	on sapphire substrates. On doping with Si, the resistivity of the
	virgin ZnO thin films was found to decrease from similar to 3.0 x
	10(-2) to 6.2 x 10(-4) Omega cm and its bandgap increased from about
	3.28 to 3.44 eV at different doping concentrations. XPES measurements
	revealed that Si predominantly occupies the Zn lattice sites in the
	Si+3 state. The increase in the bandgap of the ZnO films with increasing
	Si concentration was found to be due to the collective effects of
	high carrier concentration induced Burstein-Moss blue shift and bandgap
	narrowing. Efficient photoluminescence (PL) was observed at room
	temperature from these Si doped ZnO films. The bandgaps obtained
	from the PL measurements were found to be Stokes shifted as compared
	with those obtained from the transmission spectra. Si doping of ZnO
	offers the possibility of developing superior transparent conducting
	electrodes for applications such as in display panels, solar cells
	and transparent resistive non-volatile memories.}},

  abstract = {{This paper presents simple but accurate closed form equations for
	Band Gap Narrowing (BGN) for n and p type, Si, Ge, GaAs and Ge(x)Si1-x
	alloys and strained layers. The equations are derived by identifying
	the four components of BGN: exchange energy shift of the majority
	band edge, correlation energy shift of the minority band edge and
	impurity interaction shifts of the two band edges. In the simple
	parabolic band approximation, the BGN is determined by the effective
	masses of the carriers and the relative permittivity of the semiconductor.
	For real semiconductors, known corrections due to anisotropy of the
	bands, due to multi-valleys in a band and due to interactions between
	sub-bands are used. The values of BGN for n Si, n Ge and n and p
	GaAs calculated using this simple formulation agree closely with
	the theoretical values calculated by other authors using advanced
	but complex many body methods and the Random Phase Approximation
	for screening effects. For p Si and p Ge ours appear to be the first
	calculations taking all interactions into account. Experimental values
	of BGN for all semiconductors except for p Ge for which no data could
	be found, are also in very good agreement with our theory. The Fermi
	level for n and p Si and p GaAs is determined using the published
	luminescence data. In heavily doped p type semiconductors, the values
	are found to be considerably smaller than those calculated using
	the known values of the effective density of states. The values of
	apparent BGN for n and p Si and p GaAs calculated using experimentally
	determined Fermi levels are in remarkably good agreement with the
	experimental values derived from device measurements. All results
	are presented in a form which lends itself to numerical computer
	simulation studies.}},

	The theoretical calculation for BM effect is in good agreement with

	and band-gap renormalization (BGR) effects. Meanwhile, the monotonic
	redshift of the near-band-gap emission detected by PL measurements
	has also been observed with increasing free-carrier concentration,
